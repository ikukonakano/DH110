<a href="#introduction">  <h2 class="lead">Introduction</h2> </a>
This project was developed as a part of the course, Digital Huamities 110: User Experience Design, offered in Fall 2022 at UCLA. It was taught by [Sookie Kim, a visiting lecturer](https://dh.ucla.edu/faculty/). This project was aimed at contributing to the second [UN Sustainable Development Goal](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) of achieving [Zero Hunger](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2). Inspired by a common climate action phrase of "thinking globally, acting locally," this project aims to support Zero Hunger by sharing, finding, and learning about food resources in the Los Angeles region. Personally, I am motivated by my academic, professional, and experiential background with hunger.

    <td>I conducted heuristic analysis on three competitors: the Slack Workspace for UCLA Food Studies minor students (a space for students to share resources), the Los Angeles Food Policy Council website (a nonprofit who offer opportunities for learning about the food system at large), and Foodfinder 211LA (a dynamic map for individuals to find food resources).

Slack gives individuals a means of sharing and finding resources but the space can be a bit overwhelming and cluttered, with no standardized way of sharing information. The Los Angeles Food Policy website provides good opportunity and visual appeal but is, again, cluttered and does not use common grouping terminology (i.e. title headers) which may users lost on where to navigate to. The Foodfinder 211LA website lead

In terms of solutions: 1) Shared resources should include specific mandatory information; 2) information should be uniform in aesthetic and in grouping terminology.
