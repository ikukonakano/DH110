## Introduction
This project was developed as a part of the course, Digital Huamities 110: User Experience Design, offered in Fall 2022 at UCLA. It was taught by [Sookie Kim, a visiting lecturer](https://dh.ucla.edu/faculty/). This project was aimed at contributing to the second [UN Sustainable Development Goal](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) of achieving [Zero Hunger](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2). Inspired by a common climate action phrase of "thinking globally, acting locally," this project aims to support Zero Hunger by sharing, finding, and learning about food resources in the Los Angeles region. Personally, I am motivated by my academic, professional, and experiential background with hunger.

## Design Statement

What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

|The main issue identified through this project 

## Competitor Analysis

|Heuristic Evaluation|
|--------------------|
|I conducted heuristic analysis on two competitors: the Slack Workspace for UCLA Food Studies minor students (a space for students to share resources) and the Los Angeles Food Policy Council website (a nonprofit who offer opportunities for learning about the food system at large).<br><br> Slack gives individuals a means of sharing and finding resources but the space can be a bit overwhelming and cluttered, with no standardized way of sharing information. The Los Angeles Food Policy website provides good opportunity and visual appeal but is, again, cluttered and does not use common grouping terminology (i.e. title headers) which may users lost on where to navigate to. <br><br> In terms of solutions: 1) Shared resources should include specific mandatory information, and 2) information should be uniform in aesthetic and in grouping terminology. <br><br> **Find the full heuristic evaluation [here](https://ikukonakano.github.io/DH110/Assignment01/)**|

|Usability Testing|
|--------------------|
I conducted a pilot usability testing on the Los Angeles Food Policy Council to support my heuristic analysis and gain further insight about improvements that could be made on resource sharing platforms. <br><br> I designed tasks that include learning about the organization and searching for resources and opportunities for the public to engage to get a better understanding of how the webpage’s organization affects the information accessibility. <br><br> These tasks confirmed my evaluation that the website is convoluted and cumbersome. This allowed me to begin understanding the perspective of users. To continue this study of users, I next performed a contextual inquiry. <br><br> **Find the full usability testing [here](https://ikukonakano.github.io/DH110/Assignment02/)**|
