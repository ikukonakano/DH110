# Project Title: Food Family

**UX Project by Ikuko Nakano**

|Introduction|
|---|
|This project was developed as a part of the course, Digital Huamities 110: User Experience Design, offered in Fall 2022 at UCLA. It was taught by [Sookie Kim, a visiting lecturer](https://dh.ucla.edu/faculty/). This project was aimed at contributing to the second [UN Sustainable Development Goal](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) of achieving [Zero Hunger](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2). Inspired by a common climate action phrase of "thinking globally, acting locally," this project aims to support Zero Hunger by sharing, finding, and learning about food resources in the Los Angeles region. Personally, I am motivated by my academic, professional, and experiential background with hunger.|
