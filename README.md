## Introduction

This project was developed as a part of the course, Digital Huamities 110: User Experience Design, offered in Fall 2022 at UCLA. It was taught by [Sookie Kim, a visiting lecturer](https://dh.ucla.edu/faculty/). This project was developed with the aim of supporting the second [UN Sustainable Development Goal](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) of achieving [Zero Hunger](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2). Inspired by a common climate action phrase of "thinking globally, acting locally," this project aims to support Zero Hunger by sharing, finding, and learning about food resources in the Los Angeles region. Personally, I am motivated by my academic, professional, and experiential background with hunger.

## Design Statement

**Through this project, I hope to connect the population of people who are in need of food resources with those who are able to provide them, as well as educate individual who are curious about the issue at large.**

Food is a basic necessity. In the same way clean water, clothing, and shelter are all basic to human survival, food is critical. However, hunger continues to be and is becoming an increasingly large issue. This project aims to contribute to the solution of global hunger by locally alleviating the hunger crisis in Los Angeles. This is done through the website but being a simple, intuitive, clear platform to find, share, and learn about food resources.

## Competitor Analysis

### Heuristic Evaluation
I conducted heuristic analysis on two competitors: the Slack Workspace for UCLA Food Studies minor students (a space for students to share resources) and the Los Angeles Food Policy Council website (a nonprofit who offer opportunities for learning about the food system at large).

Slack gives individuals a means of sharing and finding resources but the space can be a bit overwhelming and cluttered, with no standardized way of sharing information. The Los Angeles Food Policy website provides good opportunity and visual appeal but is, again, cluttered and does not use common grouping terminology (i.e. title headers) which may users lost on where to navigate to.

In terms of solutions: 1) Shared resources should include specific mandatory information, and 2) information should be uniform in aesthetic and in grouping terminology.

### Usability Testing
I conducted a pilot usability testing on the Los Angeles Food Policy Council to support my heuristic analysis and gain further insight about improvements that could be made on resource sharing platforms.

I designed tasks that include learning about the organization and searching for resources and opportunities for the public to engage to get a better understanding of how the webpage’s organization affects the information accessibility.

These tasks confirmed my evaluation that the website is convoluted and cumbersome. This allowed me to begin understanding the perspective of users. To continue this study of users, I next performed a contextual inquiry.

## User Testing: Contextual Inquiry

The contextual inquiry I conducted allowed me to further understand users’ motivations for using platforms for learning, sharing and finding food resources. I interviewed an individual who was on the Slack workspace mentioned in the heuristic analysis. 

What I found was that sharing and finding resources within even a centralized community such as a college campus was not easy to come by. The interviewee cites a lack of centralization, a lack of simplicity, and a lack of user autonomy.

With these insights in mind, I was able to begin thinking about who the redesigned platform would serve.

## UX Storytelling

I thought about the audience of my platform by creating personas and their associated empathy maps. In these, I identified their goals, frustrations, motivations, and personalities, as well as what they would do, say, think, and and feel. 

I created 2 personas: Jacob Green - the curious and hungry student, Claudia Frasier - the engaging and networking professor.

Below are an example of what I created for Jacob.
|Persona|Empathy Map|
|---|---|
|<img width="590" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-29 at 1 21 48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56706104/204489862-630ef641-45a7-4af7-86a0-cce45503a855.png">|<img width="590" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-29 at 1 21 27" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56706104/204489880-f3a79572-bc29-43b8-9ba1-55ca712b12b2.png">|

Using these personas and empathy maps, I was able to put myself into the shoes of these users and think about the redesign as it would most benefit these users.

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variations

[Note: some of my tasks and information was edited based on feedback from the professor so the past sections may reflect different research questions and objectives than the ones at hand.]

After getting into the perspective of potential users, I then began to draft the wireframes of my prototype. This allowed me to generate fast designs to test on users without investing too much time into details of the prototype (e.g. colors and shapes).

I developed my wireframe based off of the core functionality I hoped for this program to acheive: sharing, finding, and learning.

Below are examples of wireframes I developed:

The graphic design elements variations were designed with various ideas in mind, including (but not limited to) Gestalt's theory of grouping visual elements, ensuring the color contrasts meet AAA standard, nad variation of typography and shapes.

## Low Fidelity Prototype

Below is the Low Fidelity Wireflow, meant to give an overarching view of the prototype (not give a detailed look at any one page):

I conducted user testing with the rudimentary wireframe and wireflow of the low fidelity prototype and I got feedback about the design, and certain key features that I would make sure to properly design or remove due to complexity. This included assign asterisks on required fields, and changing the criteria question into an short-paragraph section instead of an additive table.

## High Fidelity Prototype

Using feedback from the low fidelity prototype testing as well as the graphic design elements I decided on, I began the high fidelity prototype of this project.
