# Project Title: Food Family

**UX Project by Ikuko Nakano**

## Introduction

|What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.|
---
|My project will be in an effort to improve the user experience of a Food Studies minor at UCLA.|


## Design Statement

What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

I am both a student of the food studies minor and an intern at a nonprofit that works within the realm of food activism. A common request among these communities is the need for a centralized hub for information, events, opportunities, and collaborations to be shared. If you look up "Los Angeles Food Activism" on Google, you'll quickly find the scattered links that only lead to specific organizations and their internal events. Other alternatives that consolidate resources are often in private communities and don't allow the public to join. Therefore, I would like to focus my project on creating a resource-sharing platform to support food activism.
