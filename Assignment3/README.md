# Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry

Coco Nakano | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Description of Project

### Step :one: : Specify the research goal & requirements ([refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.31-33](http://d1r3w4d5z5a88i.cloudfront.net/assets/guide/Field%20Guide%20to%20Human-Centered%20Design_IDEOorg_English-ee47a1ed4b91f3252115b83152828d7e.pdf))

**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**

> This project would support users in networking and sharing opportunities/inquiries. This project will provide a centralized and convenient space to share resources to the food studies community.

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? ([reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs))**

> The basic need/goal involved in this activity is cognitive need. This refers to the need for creativity, learning, and meaning. This project will support this need by providing a means to share these resources and expand modes of experience and knowledge for users. Additionally, this will provide the basic need of belonging and love. This project will fulfill this basic need by creating a centralized hub for students to connect and network.

**What is (are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

> The traditional/current solutions used to satisfy the need of centralizing resources within the Food Studies minor at UCLA is the use of an email listserv. With this email listserv, the Food Studies academic counselor sends a list of resources that other people (students, faculty, external organizations) have sent to her. This listserv then reaches students, alumni, and faculty. 

**What is (are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**

> The listserv is an inefficient means of sharing information. It requires a middle person (academic counselor) to both compile and format this information so it is readable and appealing to the people in the listserv. 

### Step :two: : Target users ([refer to the field guideline by IDEO](http://d1r3w4d5z5a88i.cloudfront.net/assets/guide/Field%20Guide%20to%20Human-Centered%20Design_IDEOorg_English-ee47a1ed4b91f3252115b83152828d7e.pdf), p.44-51)

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**

> Demographic: Users are Food Studies minor students, alumni, and faculty at UCLA; variety of majors or other fields of study
> Preferences: Users are interested in sharing resources to other people in the UCLA community
> Expertise: Users should have some level of expertise in marketing opportunities and resources (includes basic information including location, time, date, purpose, partners)
> Mainstream vs. Extreme: Mainstream users will be those who are looking through the available resources. They will not have resources to share themselves. Extreme users will be those who primarily have resources to share with little interest in looking through the resources.

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**

> Users would primarily post resources at home or on campus because they want to share opportunities and because they will need the time to cross-reference information and upload images.
> Users would primarily look through the resources on their computers because they are interested in getting involved and because these resources will typically require additional steps best done on a computer. 

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**

> The users would have two primary actions on the website: providing information about a resource or looking through the provided resources. In order to provide information about a resource, the user would need to input relevant information (time, location, details, next steps, images). In order to look through the provided information, the user will need to scroll, filter resources, and be able to follow the next steps of each resource.

### Step :three: : Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 

> For my qualitative research method, I will choose overt observation via active participatory interaction using contextual inquiry. I will be having the user consent to my recording their expressions, asking background questions, and interjections with questions as they conduct a task. In other words, I will both ask interview questions and take observations.
> The reason for this choice is because I would like to see the users' interaction with current methods of finding and sharing resources to the food studies community, as well as if they would benefit from an improved design that I am proposing for my project.

### Step :four: : Plan the details

> Since the action of finding and sharing resources is largely done via computers, I will be conducting the contextual inquiry **remotely**. I will be **recording them via the Zoom application**, as well as **collecting a transcript**.
> I will be observing the users actions taken in order to find resources and share resources.

## Contextual Inquiry

Here is the **[script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cs6mBN3LS5G_ky92IQjkEkR6z09mAUTlzMs9ZVY188I/edit?usp=sharing)**.

Here is the **[recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PdjHojbhLiTAZhroiHuREX_Fbtcg0Tif/view?usp=sharing)**. (Note: Zomo glitched and the video feed of the interviewee did not show while she was screensharing.)

Here is the **[transcript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v6-KqM4j8vOz0e-xfyYaEjCvYxGOVOWGURgVkUls5NA/edit?usp=sharing)**.

### Here are some interesting quotes from the contextual inquiry transcript

:one: The interviewee did not feel there was a centralized platform to find or share resources
> "I honestly don't really or like I feel like there's not like a central place that I look"

:two: The interviewee felt the newsletter for the Food Studies minor inhibited user autonomy
> When asked about their satisfaction with the Food Studies minor newsletter, they stated a down side was tat they could not "quickly share a piece of information myself"

:three: The interviewee felt there were too many Slack's in their personal life to keep track of, despite liking Slack as a platform
> Referring to Slack, the user disliked that "there's just like so many platforms of information" with the app.

:four: The interviewee felt that they would be more inclined to use a centralized platform if other's regularly used it as well.
> Referred to this as a "snowball effect"

## Reflection

I think this task went relatively well. There was a technological issue that did not occur in the pilot testing of the participants video feed not displaying while they were sharing screen. This inhibits my ability to analyze their facial expressions during the task. This is something I will make sure to sort out for the future. I believe that these questions were generally pretty well-organized and allowed the user to give detailed feedback about their experience sharing/finding resources. I would improve my delivery of the script by reading the questions directly off of the script. I was too focused on making it sound like a discussion that I strayed away from the wording of the question, which made some of the questions confusing to the user.
