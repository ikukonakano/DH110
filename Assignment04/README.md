# Assignment 04: User Personas

## Purpose of UX Storytelling in My Project

> Generally, the purpose of UX storytelling is to walk in the shoes of users and ensure an empathetic understanding of  users' experiences. This consists of the development of thorouhg prototypical users for research. In so doing, it allows developers and designers to create products and improvements that will best support users' intentions on the product. Additionally, this minimizes biases of those involved in the product development by critically thinking about personalities outside of one's own.
> 
> Specifically, for this project, the purpose of UX storytelling is to understand the perspective of various members of the Food Studies community. As people within the community are at various stages of involvement, accomodating the diversity of users is especially important in making this an accessible and useful product for users.

## TWO Personas and Empathy Maps

## Two Tasks, Scenarios, and Journey Maps

### Task 1

> Connect with other students within the Food Studie minor based on similar interests

### Task 1 -  Scenario 1 with Jacob

**Why?**

> Jacob was talking to his friends he was studying biology with one night. His friends were all bonding about how the student organizations they were a part of were doing well but they were stressed about whether or not their experience with those organizations was enough. Jacob had felt doubts about his amount of involvement in student projects before but he was always confident in himself about going at his own pace. This conversation, however, changed that. He felt nervous and anxious about whether or not, compared to all his friends, he’d get into medical school at this rate. He knows he wants to find this intersection of nutrition and medicine so he is digging through the internet to find the contact of the Food Studies Academic Counselor to set up a meeting. But after sending an email, all he can do is wait for a response.

**How?**

> The next morning, he sees an email in his inbox from the counselor. The email contains a link to UCLA’s Food Family, a website that connects to your UCLA account and allows you to connect with other students. Quickly, he opens the link, signs in, and is prompted to populate his profile. His major, minor, and year are prefilled, but he includes his interest in medicine and nutrition. After finishing his profile, he closes the pop-up to see a series posts and comments about different food studies opportunities. As he’s scrolling through the website, realizes that not only are there enough opportunities, there might be too many opportunities! The volume of resources is now stressing him out. He sees a filter on the top, and uses keywords like“nutrition” and “volunteer.”  In the search bar, he looks up “biology” to see if he can find students or mentors in the minor with some background in biology, and score! The search results are sections by type (e.g. faculty/staff, student, or event/project). He clicks the first students to find their profile and projects. Excitedly, he sends a message to this student about meeting up. He goes back to the search results and does this with 3 other students. Even though there’s more work ahead, he’s feeling a lot more confident about his future prospects now that there are students he can relate to and projects to peruse. He bookmarks this website on his browser and confidently gets ready for class, getting ready to tell all of his friends.

### Task 2

> Finding students speakers to come to her class to share their leadership and experience

### Task 2 -  Scenario 2 with Claudia

**Why?**

> Claudia is teaching a course next quarter on Food Activism in Los Angeles. As part of the course, she is interested in getting student leaders within the field of food activism to come speak in the class and show her students what kinds of organizations and opportunities are available. As the faculty advisor for a few student projects, she has some connection to student leaders. She reaches out to those students about any connections to other student projects. Expectedly, they all reach out and suggest the projects that Claudia is already an advisor for. They are all in the field of arts and humanities with respect to food. As a professor who is cognizant and vocal about the need for interdisciplinary approaches in all subjects (and especially in the food field), she wants to find student leaders working on projects outside of arts and humanities. She emails the Food Studies Academic Counselor about where to find different student organizations on campus.

**How?**
> Swiftly, the academic counselor responds to Claudia. In her message, “Claudia, I believe you should have had an account set up with UCLA’s Food Family when you officially became a professor who was teaching a course that had given student credit for the Food Studies minor.” In the message, the counselor also includes a link to the Food Family and describes its use. Claudia, rightfully, is nervous about having to navigate a new platform. She has just gotten comfortable with CCLE when it switched to Canvas, and now there’s another platform? She nervously clicks the link, to find the UCLA authentication page that asks for UCLA ID and password. She fills that out, authenticates it with her DUO app, and gets onto the landing page of the website. A pop up appears: “Looks like you’ve already set up an account and profile, do you want a tutorial?” She clicks yes, and proceeds to see various text bubbles appear that show the functionality of the different sections of the website. First, it begins with making sure her profile is updated. She populates it with the new research she’s working on. Then, she learns about where she can see people’s posts for opportunities, events, and resources. She scrolls through and is explained how to bookmark posts as well as where to find the one’s she bookmarks. Using this technique during the walk-through, she already finds a few recent posts on projects she’s never heard of that she wants to contact. She’s shown how to message people on the platform, as well as find their profile to learn more about the experience and get their email. She learns how to post her own resources, and creates her first post calling for student leaders who are interested in presenting in her class. The app makes sure she includes important dates, contact information, and descriptions. Confident in her use of this platform, she finishes the tutorial and shows it off to the student’s she advises the next day.

### Task 2 - Journey Map

## Reflection

> Creating personas took a lot more thought and energy than I thought. I spent around 6 hours on this assignment. This was primarily spent creating the personas and ensuring thorough oversight in their empathy map. Additionally, I spent time creating these scenarios, as well as making sure the personas would genuinely feel supported by the end of the product use.
