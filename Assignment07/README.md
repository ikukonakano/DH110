Coco Nakano | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview

### Purpose, Process, and Project Description

>This project provides a platform for users to learn about, share and find resources for food access within the LA area.

>The purpose of this high fidelity prototype is to refine the low-fidelity prototype that was created for this application into a fleshed out and digitized design, as well as delineate workflow and tasks proposed for this applcation. This means a strong wireflow is created that navigates around the application design. 

>The process of this assignment will be designed via Figma. For this prototype, I will using Macbook Air screen size. Building this interface design system will allow me to test different features and iterative improve the interface design system efficiently in the future.

### Tasks

* Input a resource into the Food Family database
* Use map view to find various resources in Los Angeles

### The process

Here is a link to my [cognitive walkthrough survey and data](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdy_9Cg3VQ-1iQoYRd2b1rSWAE2TJiLzYCdv7RYGPSXo8LrcA/viewform?usp=sharing). This was based off [the professor's cognitive walkthrough survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqsfs4MN6LgdE-k8MHP_6bLJD7Xf0Gaou68dTnNQ7GQczfFQ/viewform).

### Findings

### Reflection
