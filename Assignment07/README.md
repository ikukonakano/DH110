# Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype

Coco Nakano | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview

### Purpose, Process, and Project Description

>This project provides a platform for users to learn about, share and find resources for food access within the LA area.

>The purpose of this high fidelity prototype is to refine the low-fidelity prototype that was created for this application into a fleshed out and digitized design, as well as delineate workflow and tasks proposed for this applcation. This means a strong wireflow is created that navigates around the application design. 

>The process of this assignment will be designed via Figma. For this prototype, I will using Macbook Air screen size. Building this interface design system will allow me to test different features and iterative improve the interface design system efficiently in the future.

### Tasks

* Input a resource into the Food Family database
* Use map view to find various resources in Los Angeles

### The process

Here is a link to my [cognitive walkthrough survey and data](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdy_9Cg3VQ-1iQoYRd2b1rSWAE2TJiLzYCdv7RYGPSXo8LrcA/viewform?usp=sharing). This was based off [the professor's cognitive walkthrough survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqsfs4MN6LgdE-k8MHP_6bLJD7Xf0Gaou68dTnNQ7GQczfFQ/viewform). This walkthrough took a total of 21 minutes.

I did a cognitive walkthrough and test with my older sister. She did not want to be recorded by filled out the survey and included comments in the prototype using my computer.

### Findings

Here are some key findings from the cognitive walkthrough:

:one: the formatting is simple and legible but inconsistent
> "simple, legible page" & "is there supposed to be a title here?"

:two: the smart animate function can be distracting
> "the fade again is a bit distracting"

:three: there are repeated questions and nonfunctioning dropdowns in the share feature
> "on step 2 the dropdown menu appears behind the other fields; on step 3 there is a repeating question"

:four: a "back" button would be useful for the sharing page
>  "in the case I want to fix something I do not know how to fix it"

Based off of these results, I have created a high-fidelity prototype 2 to reflect these changes. Specifically, I have focused on including the following:

* consistent titles and formatting
* removing some instances of smart animation
* checking for correct content
* including a back button

### Reflection
  what went smoothly or differently from your expectation
  What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing.
