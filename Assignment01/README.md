# ASSIGNMENT 01: HEURISTIC EVALUATION
# Creating a Communal Platform to Support Food Activism
Name: Coco Nakano

Course: DH 110

Session: Fall 2022
## Project Description
I am both a student of the food studies minor and an intern at a nonprofit that works within the realm of food activism. A common request among these communities is the need for a centralized hub for information, events, opportunities, and collaborations to be shared. If you look up "Los Angeles Food Resources" on Google, you'll quickly find the scattered links that only lead to specific organizations and their internal events. Other alternatives that consolidate resources are often in private communities and don't allow the public to join. Therefore, I would like to focus my project on creating a platform for specifically sharing, finding, and learning about available food resources in Los Angeles.

## Competitor Analysis
### Slack workspace for UCLA Food Studies minors

**Description**
This Slack workspace is a private workspace hosted by the Food Studies department at UCLA. In order to get access to Slack, you must be a Food Studies student or an affiliate of the program. This workspace is meant to serve as a hub for students of the minor to hear of job opportunities, events, volunteering events, and other external activities. It includes channels to discuss announcements, research opportunities, social events, food news, recipes, and others (channels start with # and are in the column on the left of the above screenshot).

**Overall Heuristic Evaluation**
Slack is a well-rounded app. The only drawback as a user is that since you likely have more than one workspace, it is not necessarily the case that the application will open up to the one for the Food Studies minor. This means, users are not prompted to look at that workspace unless by their own volition or because of the small dot next to the workspace icon to show there are unread messages.

**Heuristic Evaluation**
1. visibility of system status

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: it highlights the channel you're in so users know status/location|N/A|N/A|
|Good: in text fields, it gives a light-grey message of where you're messaging (i.e. thread of in channel), telling users where they are relative to platform|N/A|N/A|
|Good: Hovering over the button yields very clear inverted colors so users are aware it's a button|N/A|N/A|
|Good: Bolds the channels that include messages users haven't read so users are aware of changes to system|N/A|N/A|
|Good: says reconnecting when waiting for wifi to return to users are aware of wifi / updating status|N/A|N/A|

2. match between system and real world

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: Can start threads / reply to specific messages to prevent confusion in channel|N/A|N/A|
|Good: Can use emojis similar to texting for variable formality of messages|N/A|N/A|
|Certain keyboard commands are different when in Slack (e.g. hyperlinking on most of platforms is command+K where as in Slack it's command+shift+U|1|This could be the result of different programming standards specific to the platform. I found the solutions to keyboard commands by googling, but it would help to make it the same as the users keyboard for all other purposes|

3. user control and freedom

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: clear X's on extra windows that users can close without closing the app, allowing for mobility around platform|N/A|N/A|
|Good: can open multiple windows within the desktop app so users can see multiple messages at once to allow for diverse use/views|N/A|N/A|
|Good: Can privately message individuals in workspace about opportunities they send in public channels allowing for user control in platform use|N/A|N/A|

4. consistency and standards

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: jargon such as channel, thread, and workspace is used on app and common in communication platforms|N/A|N/A|
|Good: clear distinctions between the different channels are their use, making use of platform clear for users|N/A|N/A|

5. error prevention

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: if wifi is cut off, messages is greyed out and unsent which prevents users confusion about sent status|N/A|N/A|
|Good: character limit changes as letters are typed within channel-name when creating a channel to direct users during name-choosing process instead of after|N/A|N/A|
|Allows users to add more than 8 people in a group chat even though capacity is 8, and type message (it just doesn't sent even though send button is still green)|1|Could be the result of convenience on the backend, to solve they should grey out send button & not let users add more members to private group beyond capacity

6. recognition rather than recall

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: users' names pop up once a letter is typed when adding members to chat or channel so users can see  users in workspace they can reference|N/A|N/A|
|Good: recently used emojis pop up first, including customized emojis for user convenience|N/A|N/A|
|Good: location to look at message draft at top of channel list so users can recall|N/A|N/A|
|Good: Drop down to create bookmark under each channel instead of having to dig to find the mechanism to back up|N/A|N/A|

7. flexibility and efficiency of use

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: Notifications are customizable for flexible options|N/A|N/A|
|Good: Can schedule slack messages so users can send at specified time|N/A|N/A|
|Good: include customizable emojis per workspace to create local language amongst users|N/A|N/A|

8. aesthetic and minimalist design

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|The workspace is overwhelming because there is a lot of information on one tiny screen|2|Source is owner's choice to create too many channels; reduce clutter by having less channels|
|Not prompted to look at workspace unless it is already open or you have deliberate action to take there|2|Source is minimizing superfluous notifications at the cost of seeing message; send reminder notifications about unread messages in recently unvisited channels|

9. help users recognize. diagnose, and recover from error

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: the error when too many members are added to a group chat includes a button to create a channel instead with unlimited members|N/A|N/A|
|Good: Prompted to try again when you add spaces, periods, or most punctuation to channel-name so users can recover from error|N/A|N/A|
|Unclear what punctuations can/can't be added to channel name|1|Source is the error message; include list of okay punctuations in error|

10. help and documentation

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|There aren't many messages about how to use the workspace from the owner/creator of the workspace so it is difficult to gauge how users should use the workspace and promoting comfortability in doing so|2|Source is from owner/creator of workspace as facilitators of this platform; have a message / tutorial for new users and show messages in channels from a diversity of students|
|Good: bookmarks are available in each channel so documentation can be saved|N/A|N/A|

**Description**
The Los Angeles Food Policy Council is a nonprofit whose mission is to ensure food is healthy, sustainable, affordable and fair for all. This is primarily done within their Working Group Network, which is a collection of groups made up of internal members that work towards various goals related to food activism. There are events and opportunities available to people outside of the working group through their newsletter. Their website contains basic information about their organization, as well as the different working groups and how to join them, the issues they specifically tackle, former programs, former engagement opportunities, former publications, and a blog.

**Overall Heuristic Evaluation**
This website includes all of the basic information that one may want to see. It is a relatively simple website. It could be improved in terms of the transparency of the content. More explicit explanations of what it means to get involved and see available opportunities would be useful for users to feel up to date.

**Heuristic Evaluation**
1. visibility of System Status

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|When selecting the title of items in the menu bar, it is unclear where it goes to the users and in reality it goes to the first item within the menu|2|source is redirection of menu item to first sub item within menu; have title pages for each menu item that users go to when they click on titles; show which menu bar users are under when they select an item within one of the menu items|
|Good: Hovering over the button yields very clear inverted colors so users are aware it's a button|N/A|N/A|

2. match between system and real world

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: They have nested menu items similar to how folders on computers work, mimicking real world system|N/A|N/A|
|Good: Menu bar delineates different genres of opportunities that users might be interested in (publications, programs, engagement) to categorize external opportunities|N/A|N/A|
|The delineation between the different genres above are not clear (specifically: events, programs, engagement)|2|source is the overlapping nature of terms chosen; consolidate all opportunities under one menu item and delineate within the menu tab; consolidate the different genres|
3. user control and freedom

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|When prompted to donate, a pop up appears. The X to exit the popup is very light and unclear|1|source is color choice of X and its similarity to background color; allow users to click outside of the popup on the web page to exit, as well as making a clear X|
|No information on which menu item you're under|1|source is lack of status; have a tracking bar on top that shows where you are nested under|

4. consistency and standards

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: They have standard page titles such as "Home", "About Us", etc. which many websites have|N/A|N/A|
|Good: Have whole pages dedicated to organization specific terms such as collective impact and Good Food For All Agenda which creates local language between users|N/A|N/A|

5. error prevention

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: Relatively static website so minimal points of error|N/A|N/A|
|Good: All links seem to work and go places which minimizes 404s|N/A|N/A|

6. recognition rather than recall

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: include all social media logos as a footer on all pages so users can click on and go directly to LAFPC's profile|N/A|N/A|
|Good: When donating, you're given suggestions for values donation that you can click, and options of repeating or one-time donations are in a drop-down to promote certain donation value norms|N/A|N/A|
|Good: there are "Join me" buttons under each working group, which is the main mode of participation as a public member|N/A|N/A|
|Users do not know they can get recurring notifications via email about LAFPC for updates and information|1|Source is a lack of user reminders; have mailing list sign-up be the first prompt users get|

7. flexibility and efficiency of use

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Can't sign-in to have an account, meaning there is no ability to customize as well as less of a social contract to frequent the site|1|source is open-source nature of their website; solve by creating sign-in; alternatively, nothing as this is the cost-benefit of being publicly accessible|

8. aesthetic and minimalist design

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: Consistent colors throughout the website that match their logo for aesthetics|N/A|N/A|
|Could have the mailing list email field be in line with aesthetic of rest of website|1|source is preset standards for their field; change style to match|

9. help users recognize. diagnose, and recover from error

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: In email field for mailing list, if you input and invalid email and click "subscribe" you will be prompted to input a valid email address|N/A|N/A|
|Good: If you type in non-numerical values into the money field under donations, it will autocorrect to zero|N/A|N/A|

10. help and documentation

|Evaluation|Severity Rating|Solution|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Good: Thorough explanations of their local terms for user understanding|N/A|N/A|
|Unclear what being a member of a working group involved|2|Source is lack of documentation; create a small section of information on top of working group breakdown to explain what it means to be a member|
