## Overview

### Purpose, Process, and Project Description
>This project provides a platform for users to learn about, share and find resources for food access within the LA area.

The purpose of this interface design is to refine the low-fidelity prototype that was created for this appliaction into a fleshed out and digitized design.This means it includes design elements such as color, size, and typographic choice. This interface will be designed via Figma. For these designs I will using Macbook Air screen size. The dimensions of the frames for these designs were based on the iPhone 11 Pro / X screen size. I utilized various resources to create the graphic design system, including Google Fonts, *** *** ***. Building this interface design system will allow me to test different features and iterative improve the interface design system efficiently in the future.

The frame I designed is the following:

### Color Schemes

#### Color Palette

Inspiration was taken from the [Los Angeles Food Policy Website](goodfoodla.org) that the heuristic analysis and user testing was done on.

## Accessibility Check (Color Contrast)

## Description of your decision making process about the final graphical interface design

Layout testing: Since the map is the primary function of this page, the map is takes up 4 rows and 3 columns worth os space. The row margins were intended to leave space for the browsers' functions. The column margins are to ensure everything is visible and comfortably spaces. If the column margins weren't there, the screen would like cramped.
