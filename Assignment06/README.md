## Overview

### Purpose, Process, and Project Description
>This project provides a platform for users to learn about, share and find resources for food access within the LA area.

The purpose of this interface design is to refine the low-fidelity prototype that was created for this appliaction into a fleshed out and digitized design.This means it includes design elements such as color, size, and typographic choice. This interface will be designed via Figma. For these designs I will using Macbook Air screen size. The dimensions of the frames for these designs were based on the iPhone 11 Pro / X screen size. I utilized various resources to create the graphic design system, including Google Fonts, *** *** ***. Building this interface design system will allow me to test different features and iterative improve the interface design system efficiently in the future.

The frame I designed is the following:
