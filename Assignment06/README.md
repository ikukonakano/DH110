# Assignment 06: Interface Design System

Coco Nakano | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview

### Purpose, Process, and Project Description
>This project provides a platform for users to learn about, share and find resources for food access within the LA area.

The purpose of this interface design is to refine the low-fidelity prototype that was created for this appliaction into a fleshed out and digitized design.This means it includes design elements such as color, size, and typographic choice. This interface will be designed via Figma. For these designs I will using Macbook Air screen size. The dimensions of the frames for these designs were based on the iPhone 11 Pro / X screen size. I utilized various resources to create the graphic design system, including Google Fonts, *** *** ***. Building this interface design system will allow me to test different features and iterative improve the interface design system efficiently in the future.

The frame I designed is the following:

### Color Schemes

#### Color Palette

Inspiration was taken from the [Los Angeles Food Policy Website](goodfoodla.org) that the heuristic analysis and user testing was done on.

### Layout Test

This layout has 5 rows and 5 columns. The margins for the rows are 80. The margins for the columns are 30. Since the map is the primary function of this page, the map is takes up 4 rows and 3 columns worth os space. The row margins were intended to leave space for the browsers' functions. The column margins are to ensure everything is visible and comfortably spaces. If the column margins weren't there, the screen would like cramped. The text explaining the purpose and function of the page was put into one brief column on the left.

## Description of your decision making process about the final graphical interface design

### Typeface family and size

Header: I chose a decorative typeface called "Permanent Marker" that was used for the title of the page 
For all other text, I chose a typeface family called "Inter".

Body text: “Inter”, Regular, 16 pt., Line spacing: 2, Letter spacing: -0.17 px
Subtitle text: “Inter”, Medium, 18 pt., Letter spacing: -0.17 px
Caption text: “Inter”, Regular, 10 pt., Line spacing: 1.5. Letter spacing: 0 px
How I made the decision: I chose the decorative typeface "Mochiy Pop One" because I felt like it looked like a fun font that was still legible. I didn't want to overuse the font, which is why I opted to use it scarcely for areas like the headers, or for the name of the app on the landing page. I used a 24pt size for the title text because it was 1.5x the size of the size of my body text.

I chose the typeface family "Inter" for everything else in the app because it is a sans-serif font that looks clean and easy to read. It also had multiple weight options, which all looked great. I used a 16pt size for my body text in regular weight because it was suggested, and I felt like it was a good size when I tested it on the wireframe. I used a 18pt size for my subtitle text in medium weight for the subtitles. I chose a different font weight because I wanted to create a stronger emphasis on the information provided here. I also made the font size a bit larger so that it is more noticable than the body text, but wasn't overbearing the page. I used a 10pt size for my caption text in regular weight because this size fit the best underneath the icons that I wanted to use this text for without going too small.

Color scheme
background color (sand): FFFAF6
text color (black): 393939
Accent colors

brown (for headers and footers): 60492C
blue (for interactive elements): 2D8B90
green (for interactive elements): 748106
How I made the decision: For the color scheme, I wanted to use Hawaii's Division of State Parks website as inspiration, as well as the images of Hawaii displayed on their front page. The colors I chose (sand and blue) were very nature and beach themed, which is inspired by what Hawaii is best known for. The brown and green was also inspired by the branding used on Hawaii's Division of State Parks website, so overall, I am happy with the final color scheme. My interviewee also noticed how the colors reminded them of the beach and palm trees, which was my intention with these colors.

Layout grid and spacing
for the layout grid, I used a 10 pixel grid, where the distance between each grid space represented 10 pixels.
How I made the decision: I chose to use a grid because I was familiar with grids from my past graphic design experiences and found them easier to use and organize spacing based on my personal experiences. I also used 3 grid spaces (aka 30 pixels) a lot for the design elements and spacing. For example, the drop down menu's height was 3 grid spaces, the gutter was 3 grid spaces, and the distance between each state park component was 3 grid spaces as well. This was done to provide more consistency within the design when it came to spacing.

I put the purpose and the "how to use" description both on the left of the screen. This is because
