# Assignment 06: Interface Design System

Coco Nakano | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview

### Purpose, Process, and Project Description
>This project provides a platform for users to learn about, share and find resources for food access within the LA area.

The purpose of this interface design is to refine the low-fidelity prototype that was created for this appliaction into a fleshed out and digitized design.This means it includes design elements such as color, size, and typographic choice. This interface will be designed via Figma. For these designs I will using Macbook Air screen size. The dimensions of the frames for these designs were based on the iPhone 11 Pro / X screen size. I utilized various resources to create the graphic design system, including Google Fonts, *** *** ***. Building this interface design system will allow me to test different features and iterative improve the interface design system efficiently in the future.

The frame I designed is the following:

### Color Schemes

#### Color Palette

Inspiration was taken from the [Los Angeles Food Policy Website](goodfoodla.org) that the heuristic analysis and user testing was done on.

### Layout Test

This layout has 5 rows and 5 columns. The margins for the rows are 80. The margins for the columns are 30. Since the map is the primary function of this page, the map is takes up 4 rows and 3 columns worth os space. The row margins were intended to leave space for the browsers' functions. The column margins are to ensure everything is visible and comfortably spaces. If the column margins weren't there, the screen would like cramped. The text explaining the purpose and function of the page was put into one brief column on the left.

## Description of your decision making process about the final graphical interface design

### Typeface family and size

Title text: "Permanent Marker", 50 pt., Line Height: 30, Letter Spacing: 1 px

For all other text, I chose a typeface family called "Work Sans".

Body text: Regular, 16 pt., Line Height: 20, Letter Spacing: 0.6 px

Menu text: Regular, 14 pt., Line Height: 16, Letter Spacing: 0.6 px

Button text: Regular, 14

Key text: Regular, 14, Letter Spacing: 0.6 px, Line Height: 16

Pop-up text: Mixed, 7 & 8 pt., Letter Spacing: 0.08, Line Height: 10

Rationale: I made the choice to use "Permanent Marker" for the title because I thought it was an interesting and different font that was still legible. Since this is a website that uses crowdsourced information, this font in particular felt especially hand-written. I used it sparingly because it would be overwhelming as a user to see this font everywhere in more text heavy places (i.e. the "how to use section"). I used bigger text for the title to make it pop, and I made the section on the left of the screen a bit bigger than the key/legend so users would be drawn to it before using the map.

I made the choice to use "Work Sans" for all other text because it is a simple, clean, and very legible font. I used the various weighting options to my advantage. For example, I change the weight of the "How to Use" title in between two section of body text on the left to differentiate these sections and make it look easier to read. Additionally, this font came in hand when creating the pop-up. The pop-up has smaller font because there are many items in the map, and so all the information to fit concisely within the map. In the pop-up, I utilize the various weights and styles (bold, italicized) to differentiate titles/section and content. 

### Color scheme

Light mode / dark mode

body background color / body text color (white): FFFFFF

body text color / body background color (black): 393939


**Accent colors**

brown (for title): 60492C

blue (for subtitle within body text): 2D8B90

green (for interactive elements): 78B351 & 9AC77C

Rationale: I used the Los Angeles Food Policy Council (LAFPC)'s website as inspiration. However, for accessibility purposes, I wanted to chose colors that allowed for more contrast. Thus, I based the color scheme on the LAFPC's website but changed them a bit to reflect this. For example, as opposed to the orange (F59338) that is used for their website, I used the brown color above. I acted similarly for the blue and green.

Layout grid and spacing
for the layout grid, I used a 10 pixel grid, where the distance between each grid space represented 10 pixels.
How I made the decision: I chose to use a grid because I was familiar with grids from my past graphic design experiences and found them easier to use and organize spacing based on my personal experiences. I also used 3 grid spaces (aka 30 pixels) a lot for the design elements and spacing. For example, the drop down menu's height was 3 grid spaces, the gutter was 3 grid spaces, and the distance between each state park component was 3 grid spaces as well. This was done to provide more consistency within the design when it came to spacing.

I put the purpose and the "how to use" description both on the left of the screen. This is because
