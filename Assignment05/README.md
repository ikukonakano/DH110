# Assignment 04: Low-Fidelity Prototype

Coco Nakano | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview

[Note: some of my tasks and information was edited based on feedback from the professor so the past assignments may reflect different research questions than the ones at hand.]

### Purpose and Project Description
 
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to outline the basic functionality of the app, test it before investing many resources into a more developed version, discovering and fixing problems earlier on, and doing this all at a low cost. 

Specifically, this project will provide a platform for users to learn about, share and find resources for food access within the LA area. 

### User Research

Based on the contextual inquiry conducted via my [user research](https://github.com/ikukonakano/DH110/blob/main/Assignment3/README.md) and feedback from the professor, I will be focusing on these research questions:
* How might we develop food education by sharing food resources?
* How do you effectively share food resources to people facing hunger?
* How can we ensure sharing was effective?

### User Personas

Then, I created [user personas](https://github.com/ikukonakano/DH110/blob/main/Assignment04/README.md) of potential users that may need a :
* A professor who runs a nonprofit in food activism and wants to share opportunities to get involved in her nonprofit that provides food
* A student just joining the food studies minor and looking the resources on how to get involved in food activism beyond the classroom based off his specific interest (Note: based off feedback, this persona should be changed to a student who is interested in learning more about hunger in Los Angeles and is interested in resources for getting food)

### Tasks/Features
* Share a food resource
* Find a food resource
* Learn about hunger on global, USA, and CA/LA level

## User testing
User was a friend who is in her mid 20s. She has experience with food banks, experiencing food insecurity, and curious to learn more.

Note of users confusion & enjoyment (written in images and written below):

Task 1 - What happens if I click next without filling in all the info? 

Task 1 - How do I add more than 1 criteria? I see the plus sign but it isn’t clear with the arrows

Task 2 - I like this flow!

Task 2 - What if a resource is outdated?

Task 3 - Simple and informative; I’m curious about the website’s overall search function & the utility of it

## Improvements Based on User Feedback

In task 1, the user experienced confusion when she saw the next button available before she “filled out” all of the information. To avoid confusion, I improve this prototype by putting asterisks by the required fields and graying out the next button until all of those fields are populated. Additionally, the user noticed the plus sign under the list of criteria during step 3 of task 1. Each row is meant to be for one criteria which the users seem to have understood. In the prototype, I would create an entire wireflow dedicated to the population and addition of a criteria.

In task 2, the user enjoyed the general flow. She was curious about the protocol for is a resource was out of date.  As an improvement, I would include a feedback survey accessible from all pages so users could easily share any feedback, be it successes or concerns, with the website.

In task 3, the user found the learning part simple because the pages were relatively static. In future prototypes I may include more dynamic activities on the “Learn” page. Although, “informative and simple” is not necessarily a negative piece of feedback and may keep the intention of the website clear. Finally, the user asked about the overall search function on the website. I included this mostly as a tool in the case that a user is very confused and/or is looking for a very specific keyword. In future prototypes, I would include a wireflow for the entire webpage’s search function.
