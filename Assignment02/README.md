# ASSIGNMENT 02: Usability Evaluation with Users
Coco Nakano | DH 110 | Fall 2022
## Pilot Usability Test
### Introduction
 The Los Angeles Food Policy Council (LAFPC) is a nonprofit whose mission is to ensure food is healthy, sustainable, affordable and fair for all. Their website is the primary source of information on their accomplishments, goals, history, and how to get involved as a member of the public. The ways individuals can get involved include joining the working group network, events/series, mailing list, and team as an employee.
 
Through conducting a heuristic analysis on the LAFPC website, the following usability problems were found to be most prominent:
1. In terms of consistency & standard, it is unclear how much a user will understand about the local terms such as "collective impact model" and "good food for all agenda"
2. In terms of consistency & standard, it is unclear (for users interested in specific programs) should go to search for those programs
3.  In terms of matching the website and the real world, it is unclear (for users interested in learning more about how to get involved) what the delineation is between the menu options of: events, programs, engagement, and join us.

Therefore, the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the LAFPC's website from the user's perspective. This usability test is a pilot test, intended to test the setting and materials. The tasks within the survey will test the user's effectivness, efficiency, and satisfaction in using the website. The tasks are the following:

1. In task 1, the user will perform a search for the Los Angeles Food Policy Council's guiding principles and areas of focus under the guise if being interested in working for the nonprofit. This task will determine the efficiency and accessibility of the definitions of their local terminology. 
2. In task 2, the user will search for a specific program listed on their website under the guise of being interested in participating in the program. This task will test how the organization of the website affects the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of the user in finding information.
3. In Task 3, the user will search for current and past opportunities as a volunteer, under the guise of having extra time and wanting to support this nonprofits cause. This task will also test how the organization of the website affects the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of the user in finding information.
 

### Methodology

**Setting & Equipment** I will conduct this usability test using the live version of the [LAFPC's website](goodfoodla.org) on-site in Los Angeles, CA with my portable MacBook Pro 2017 laptop. I will be sitting next to the pilot user, and will be using Zoom software to recording their expressions, comments, and navigation choices as we conduct the testing.

**Process** On my laptop window, there will be a split screen to show the UT survey (linked below) and the website in question. The content of the UT survey is as follows:
|Component|Purpose|Person|
|----------|---------------|--------|
|Orientation script|to orient user|moderator will recite|
|Consent form|to cover legal basis|user will sign|
|Background questions|to gauge prior experience and basic screening information|user will answer|
|Pre-test questionnaire|to gauge first impressure and intuitiveness of terminology & GUI)|user will answer|
|Tasks/Scenarios|to test potential usability issues, including stesp for each of 3 tasks|user will conduct|
|Post-test questionnaire| to rank effectivness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the website on a 5-point scale & answer SUS prompts|user will answer|
|Demographic questions|to gauge potential biases|user will answer|
